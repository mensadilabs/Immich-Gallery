## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Server Settings

Before running the app, you need to update the server configuration in `Immich Gallery/Services/ImmichService.swift`:

```swift
// Update these values with your Immich server details
private let baseURL = "http://192.168.1.100:3001" // Your Immich server URL
private let email = "admin@example.com" // Your Immich email
private let password = "password123" // Your Immich password
```

**Important**: Replace the placeholder values with your actual Immich server details:
- `baseURL`: The URL where your Immich server is running (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:3001` or `https://your-domain.com`)
- `email`: Your Immich account email address
- `password`: Your Immich account password

### 2. Network Configuration

For Apple TV to connect to your Immich server:

1. **Local Network**: If your Immich server is on the same network as your Apple TV, use the local IP address
2. **Remote Access**: If accessing remotely, ensure your server is accessible via HTTPS
3. **Firewall**: Make sure your Immich server port (default 3001) is accessible

### 3. Build and Run
